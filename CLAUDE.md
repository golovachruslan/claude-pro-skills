# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This repository contains Claude Skills - custom extensions for Claude Code that add specialized capabilities and domain knowledge.

## Repository Structure

Currently this is a new repository. As it develops, skills should be organized with clear directory structure and naming conventions that make their purpose immediately apparent.

## Working with Claude Skills

Claude Skills are designed to be executed via the Skill tool in Claude Code. When creating or modifying skills:

- Skills should have a clear, focused purpose defined in their description
- The description should specify when the skill should be used (e.g., "Use this skill when users want to...")
- Skills can include specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations
- Each skill should be self-contained and independently usable

## Development

As this repository evolves, common commands and architectural patterns should be documented here.
