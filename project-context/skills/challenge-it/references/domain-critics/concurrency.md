**Activates when:** Async code, parallel processing, shared state, database transactions, distributed systems.

**Focus:** Race conditions, deadlocks, consistency

## Questions

- Race conditions possible?
- Shared mutable state?
- Locking strategy correct?
- Deadlock potential?
- Transaction isolation level appropriate?
- Optimistic vs. pessimistic locking?
- Eventual consistency implications?
- Ordering guarantees needed?
- Idempotency for retries?
- Thread safety?
- Event ordering in async flows?

## Output Format

```markdown
### Concurrency Critic
Race condition risks:
- [Risk 1]

Consistency concerns:
- [Concern]

Synchronization issues:
- [Issue]

**Concurrency risk:** [High/Medium/Low]
```
