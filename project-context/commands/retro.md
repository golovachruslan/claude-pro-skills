Analyze the conversation history and extract key learnings to preserve in `.project-context/` files.

Review the current conversation to identify:
1. **Key learnings** - New knowledge, what worked, what didn't
2. **Decisions made** - Technical choices, design decisions, trade-offs
3. **Patterns discovered** - Coding patterns, best practices, anti-patterns
4. **Errors & solutions** - Bugs fixed, debugging insights, error handling
5. **Progress updates** - Features completed, work in progress, next steps

Then:
- Propose updates to appropriate `.project-context/` files (brief.md, architecture.md, patterns.md, progress.md)
- Show exactly what content will be added and where
- Ask for user confirmation before applying changes
- Apply approved updates while maintaining existing file structure

Use the `project-context:retro` skill to systematically extract and preserve valuable insights from this session.
