Help me plan this feature or project. Use the planner skill to:

1. Gather requirements through clarifying questions (never assume or guess)
2. Understand technical constraints and preferences
3. Create a structured implementation plan with phases
4. Identify risks, trade-offs, and dependencies
5. Define clear success criteria

If the user has already provided some context in this conversation, incorporate it and ask about what's still unclear.

Force the use of AskUserQuestion tool to clarify any ambiguities before proposing solutions.
